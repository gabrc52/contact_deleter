# Mass contact deleter

Delete many contacts matching a search query all at once!

*Do you have many contacts that contain a certain string that you want to get rid of, and they are too many to delete one by one? Maybe thousands of contacts containing the word "work"? This is the app for you!*

**DISCLAIMER: I did this app in one hour. I am not responsible for loss of data (contacts) due to accidentally confirming the deletion, or due to a potential bug in the app.**

I needed to delete thousands of contacts from my phone and I was not willing to do it one by one. The app worked for me and I was able to do what I wanted to do.

> NOTE: Please manually grant the contacts permission using the operating system's settings before using the app, otherwise it will crash.
